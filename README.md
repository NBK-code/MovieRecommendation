# Movie Recommendation System
Alternating Least Square model was used for movie recommendation. The model works on the basis of finding matrix factorization of user-item ratings table.

Once the factorization is done, we have feature vectors for users and the items. This allows us to find feature distance between two users and there by recommend movies.
